Data science seems like a new hype term for "science" but the connotations it makes may differ from that of science. For example if one to mention data science, you probably hear python,ML,tensorflow,ai etc. Wait?! Aren't those just bunch of tools? And couldn't tools be used for science? So why is data science just science? I don't know maybe its because of its more akin to practibility than academical jargon or its coming directly to the market most of the time.
